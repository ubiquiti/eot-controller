## UniFi EoT

UniFi EoT is in beta. It means that there isn't any [LTS version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_support) and we are not testing [RC versions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Release_candidate) for longer period of time because we prefer quicker development. Please fallow [Beta](https://community.ubnt.com/t5/UniFi-EoT-Beta/bd-p/UniFi_EoT_Beta) forum for updates.
